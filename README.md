# maze
Maze

The game is run from the rungame.py program. Agent.py and maze.py are placed in the same folder. Agent.py contains the class for the Agent that traverses the maze and maze.py contains the Maze class. The output.txt shows the output of the program when applied to the mazes.txt file (I copied it to new1.txt as I was running multiple unit tests and iterations). 

Run the game with the following command
python3 ./rungame.py

Please review and let me know the next steps at your earliest convenience. 

Thanks and regards,
Vijai
